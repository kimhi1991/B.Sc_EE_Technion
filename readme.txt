this is the project - Moshe Kimhi and Aviran Hazut
we dwevided the project to files so you can look at every part individualy

what we do is collect all the loops, unroll all the loops that higher then the number to unroll the user enter

if there is a loop inside a loop we do the inside one, so if there is couple of loops it do them all

we used a trick of counting the ineration to make sure we jump into the iteration we want, include all the instructions we added


just run the script ./run
(in case you put the files in a diffrend dir, change the script)


we put 10 in the num to unroll, but it works with other numbers as well

recomanded to try with 5, 10, 20 or 50, but more then 80 will give bad results for my opinion
thanks
